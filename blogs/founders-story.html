        <p>As one of the co-founders of Codemate, I am writing to share our story of building Codemate, from the initial planning and concept of what we had in our minds, to spending countless hours of programming and testing, and finally, our launch. </p>
        <h2>Balancing School and Passion</h2>
        <p>Currently being in High School in Canada, I had always planned to create this project, envisioning the plans and functions of the website throughout the school semester. Waiting for the summer break was my only chance of finally executing my plan that I had envisioned for a whole school year.</p>
        <p>Summer break was the only time where I could actually program without any interruptions from schoolwork or going to classes. Thinking about this time, I recall being extremely busy with my homework and just strived for any spare time that I had in order to explore my passion of coding and continue to learn more about different programming languages and ideas.</p>
        <h2>Turning the Vision Into Reality</h2>
        <p>Pitching this idea to my older brothers and the eventual co-founders of Codemate, we planned to make this a platform where coding education meets community collaboration, all free of charge. We also planned to include many features, implementing AI as a resource in order to create our course quizzes and projects.</p>
        <p>The most defining principle of Codemate is its non-profit commitment and mission to rely solely on donations to fund for future development of our platform - like creating more courses, improving our platform futures, and expanding our coding community within Codemate. </p>
        <p>With these principles and planning into mind, we spent our entire summer coding as much as we can, spending numerous hours programming from early morning all the way to midnight. With our goal of trying to help out the community with a completely free coding platform in mind, we were intensely driven and motivated to build Codemate and offer these tools.</p>
        <h2>Our Mission From Here On</h2>
        <p>Of course, this process wasn't always smooth. We struggled with design decisions, and often debated late at night about what was best for the website. But each challenge gave us an opportunity to learn and improving our mistakes, teaching us new things - whether it was problem-solving, decision-making, or just learning how to program better things. </p>
        <p>This marks the beginning of Codemate—built from the ground up with a mission to keep education free, open, and community-driven. We’re launching with the essentials and a big goal: to grow together with the people who believe in that mission.</p>
